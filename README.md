### Hi, I'm Eduardo (Hdiyja) 👋

### 💻 Software Engineer & Algorithm Enthusiast
I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Naples Federico II with a deep fascination for how theoretical concepts translate into robust, efficient systems. My passion lies in the entire development lifecycle, from designing and implementing high-performance algorithms in modern C++ to containerizing and deploying full-stack applications. When I'm not building projects, I'm engaging with the community at conferences or exploring the intricacies of database systems and open-source tools.
